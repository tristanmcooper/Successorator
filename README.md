MS 2 Delivery Iterations 1 & 2 Velocity Calculation

Iteration 1 Planned:
- US 1 Goal adding options for today and tomorrow views [8]
- US 3 Goals can be given context [4]
- US 4 Filter goals by context [4]
- US 5 Pending goals view [2]
- US 8 Views drop-down menu [4]
- Iteration 1 Overall Test [2]

Total Hours: 24

Iteration 1 Velocity:
- Total hours of work put in: 8
- Total hours of work completed: 6 (US 8 and US 5)
- Velocity: 6/8 = 0.75

We came together and agreed that we could each put in around 12 hours of work for iteration 2.

This means we have 12*6 = 72 hours.

Taking into account a velocity of 0.75, we can 72*0.75 = 54 hours of actual work.


User Stories for iteration 2:
- Iteration 1 Overall Test [2]
- US 1 Goal adding options for today and tomorrow views [8]
- US 2 Calendar picker for recurring events [4]

- US 7 Recurring goals view [4]
- US 9 Update Today/Tomorrow Goal Lists based Recurring Goals [16]

Total Hours: 50

Assigning 50 hours of work means we are capable of completing these tasks in iteration 2 to be able to deliver MS 2 on time.
